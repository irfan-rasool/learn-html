  		CSS positioning is often misunderstood. Sometimes, in a bug-fixing fury, we apply different position values to a given selector until we get one that works. This is a tedious process that can work for a time, but it behooves us to know why specifying something like position: relative can fix your layout bug. My hope is that we can learn the position property’s values and behaviors, and most importantly, how a value can affect your markup.
